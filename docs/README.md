## What is the purpose of this project?
---
> **The origin and motivation for the development of this project were based on the observation that many humans struggle with destructive behaviors and habits that can feel all
> consuming. Recognizing the collective need for support and assistance in breaking free from these habits, the decision was made to create a community-driven project on Discord. As a 
> human myself, I understand and can empathize with the challenges associated with overcoming bad habits, and I wanted to help others who may also need assistance. This project not only
> offers an opportunity to improve skills and learn new things, but also to provide a platform for mutual support and understanding among individuals working to overcome these
> obstacles.**
